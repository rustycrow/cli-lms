<h1>My very first website...</h1>

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

<h2>DISCLAIMER:</h2>

This is silly old me finishing the Command Line Tool module of my Bootcamp.
I thought I'd add a little info for the reader to see why I'm improvising with my README.

<h2>CONTEXT</h2>

We've just spent 3 weeks running through HTML, CSS, IDE and Deployment and UI/UX concepts. It's been full on. We're a cohort of 24 and really beginnign to gel. Our intructors are fab and have been so helpful and patient. It's all beginning to sink in.

<h2>TECH</h2>

This project was built using HTML, CSS and Cloud9.
